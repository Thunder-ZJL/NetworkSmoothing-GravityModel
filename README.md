# NetworkSmoothing-GravityModel
This is part of source code of the innovative network smoothing based on the rumor-mongering, and of using the gravity to capture the interactions.
The code was designed to 'smooth' the network in the CA networks, and evalute the gene-gene interactions.
About the code environment is python 3.11 and anaconda jupyter 23.7.2. 
The data here is not available, which is available on TCGA, STRING and InnateDB, here the code is only for readers to understand and use the code to solve the problem.
